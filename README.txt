The .txt files contain initial conditions (masses, positions, velocities) for multiple different systems.

Our astr2600 package contains functions that were used to create many of these initial condition files. For some of the systems, you may want to change the parameters that were used to create them. To access these functions, run `from astr2600.nbody import systems` from within Python. Feel free to use the functions in systems.py to make other initial condition datasets, or modify them in any way you see fit.

Good luck!
